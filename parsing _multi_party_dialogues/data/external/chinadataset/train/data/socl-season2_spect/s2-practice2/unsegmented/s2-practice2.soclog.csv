5	15:01:50:354	keyser84	clay=0; ore=0; sheep=0; wheat=0; wood=0; unknown=0; knights=0; dev-cards=0		i actually tried to figure out how to add AI players to the game....	 	 
6	15:01:58:073	intemporaliter	clay=0; ore=0; sheep=0; wheat=0; wood=0; unknown=0; knights=0; dev-cards=0		Figured I should check out how the interface works...

11	15:03:59:661	keyser84	clay=0; ore=0; sheep=0; wheat=0; wood=0; unknown=0; knights=0; dev-cards=0		but I will prob. suffer a lack of wood
