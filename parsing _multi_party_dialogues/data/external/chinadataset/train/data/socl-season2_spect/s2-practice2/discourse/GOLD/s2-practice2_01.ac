 1 : intemporaliter : Hello? 3 : keyser84 : hi 5 : keyser84 : i actually tried to figure out how to add AI players to the game.... 6 : intemporaliter : Figured I should check out how the interface works... 7 : intemporaliter : Initially I got a message saying 'this server has no bots' (possibly paraphrased...) 8 : intemporaliter : Place your first settlement? 9 : keyser84 : yes, I know 10 : intemporaliter : Sorry. 11 : keyser84 : but I will prob. suffer a lack of wood 12 : keyser84 : sry, I should be faster 13 : intemporaliter : No hurry :-) 16 : keyser84 : ok, now vice versa, so me again 17 : intemporaliter : Aye. 24 : intemporaliter : Possibly not my greatest ever play, but my other choice was between your two settlements . 25 : keyser84 : yes, so now who rolls the dice? 26 : intemporaliter : It seems to have rolled for me (or at least, I didn't get the option to hit 'roll'... 27 : keyser84 : yes, game log says it... displays only 2 lines of text in my case 30 : intemporaliter : Yup. Same. Didn't notice at first. 38 : intemporaliter : Are you at all interested in trading a sheep for a brick (if you have one)? 39 : keyser84 : no, have no brick 42 : intemporaliter : Fair, I wasn't sure. 44 : keyser84 : ok, so trade is my only option 45 : intemporaliter : That must be how it shows robber movement. 46 : keyser84 : yes, that was my point 47 : keyser84 : i meant for wood 50 : keyser84 : ok, but wait, why there is a contour robber on wood-2 51 : intemporaliter : I don't know, bug? 52 : keyser84 : and the grey one on clay-9 53 : keyser84 : hmmm 54 : intemporaliter : I moved it there with the 7, then onto the brick with a soldier... 55 : keyser84 : anyway, then i have at least the low possibility of getting wood 56 : keyser84 : ah, I see 61 : intemporaliter : I was nicer that time - nothing is totally blocked now. 62 : intemporaliter : looks like it shows you a shadow of the last placing of the robber... 65 : keyser84 : yes 68 : intemporaliter : It would be nice to be able to buy something other than development cards... 69 : keyser84 : ok 70 : keyser84 : want to trade? I give 1 wheat, you give 1 sheep 71 : intemporaliter : If you get any clay, I will happily trade. Don't currently need wheat though. 72 : keyser84 : no, then not 77 : keyser84 : i give 2 wheat, you give 1 sheep? 78 : intemporaliter : Okay 89 : keyser84 : again 2 wheat for 1 sheep? 90 : intemporaliter : I'm out of sheep, I'm afraid - swapped them for clay. 91 : keyser84 : ah, ok 100 : intemporaliter : Don't suppose you'd be interested in ore for clay? 101 : keyser84 : ok, why not 104 : intemporaliter : Thank you. 114 : keyser84 : you can give sheep for wheat? 115 : intemporaliter : Is your points counter showing you 4 or 6? Yours is showing me 4, but you should have longest road? 116 : intemporaliter : I wish I had sheep. Need to roll a 4! 117 : keyser84 : 4 points, longest road i think only from 5 roads or longer 120 : keyser84 : as far as i remember the rules 122 : intemporaliter : Sounds right now. Was getting mixed up with army, which is only 3. 123 : keyser84 : ah, yes 130 : keyser84 : i was lucky to get directly the 7 132 : keyser84 : ok, 3 times 7 in a row 133 : intemporaliter : As was I. Odd steak... 134 : intemporaliter : /streak 156 : keyser84 : trade? i give 1 ore, receive 1 wood/wheat 157 : intemporaliter : I'll give you a wood for 2 ore? 158 : keyser84 : ok 184 : keyser84 : trade? i give 2 ore, receive 2 wheat 185 : intemporaliter : Okay 192 : intemporaliter : Apologies for the delay. Employment agency call. Back now. 195 : keyser84 : no problem 203 : intemporaliter : Do you have any spare wheat? I've ore or sheep on offer. 204 : keyser84 : ok, 1 wheat for 1 sheep 205 : intemporaliter : Ok 221 : keyser84 : i give 2 ore for 1 clay/wheat 222 : keyser84 : ok? 223 : intemporaliter : I have no clay or wheat, I'm afraid :-( 224 : keyser84 : ok 229 : intemporaliter : If the robber were to leave my clay :-) 232 : keyser84 : sry, has to go there :-) 235 : intemporaliter : Do you have any wheat or sheep for ore or wood? 236 : keyser84 : can you give 2 wood for 1 sheep 237 : intemporaliter : Would give 3 wood for a sheep and a wheat? 238 : keyser84 : sry, have no wheat 239 : intemporaliter : Okay, will do 2 wood for a sheep. 240 : keyser84 : ok, fine 249 : keyser84 : congrats! 250 : intemporaliter : Thank you. I got just the right development card there. 251 : keyser84 : quite nice, but the interface could be better 252 : intemporaliter : Odd playing this two player. Happier with the interface now though. 253 : keyser84 : yes 254 : keyser84 : ok, i'll leave then 255 : keyser84 : cu 256 : intemporaliter : Bye!
