Description
===========
The STAC dataset is a corpus of strategic chat conversations manually annotated with negotiation-related information, dialogue acts and discourse structures in the framework of Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT).  This dataset was developed within the context of the STAC (Strategic Conversation) project supported by the European Research Council, Grant n. 269427.

This dataset consists of 45 games segmented into Elementary Discourse Units and then annotated using the Glozz tool.  The annotations were split into subdocuments to make them easier to work with.  The text of each subdocument is associated with two stages of offset annotation in the Glozz XML format:
* the "units" file contains mentions and anaphoric relations for resources, and dialogue acts,
* the "discourse" file contains Complex Discourse Units and discourse relations.

The annotations have benefitted from several passes---a first one done by annotators hired for the STAC project and subsequent revisions done by SDRT experts.  Thanks to Julie Hall, Helen Joseph and especially Lisa Grabow Peterson for the initial round of annotations.
